## Game Description
You are a hacker attempting to enter a server, test your mathematical skills in this command-line game!

## Project 

This was a very small program that a did with pure c++ just to remember the syntax, I had learned C++ when I was in college, but never used ever since so it was good to take a small project just to refresh the memory

## The Course 

I made this Game following the [Unreal Engine C++ Developer (Unreal 4.22) - Archived Course](www.udemy.com/course/unreal-422-archived-course/) course from **GameDevTv**. Its an archived course, but I think it helps just to remember basic concepts of the language.
